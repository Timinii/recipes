    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a traditional dish in my family. Anyone can make it really. It is
      composed of traditional Mexican ingredients layered over the top of one
      another in a lasagna-like fashion (hence the name) but has little
      similarity to lasagna, so lasagna haters have no fear!
    </p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ pounds ground beef</li>
      <li>¼ cup water</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Colby-Jack cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch
        casserole dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in ground beef. Cook
        and stir until beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink,
        about 10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Add water and
        taco seasoning; cook and stir until mixture has thickened, 5 to 10
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until top tortilla layer begins to brown, 20
        to 25 minutes. Sprinkle 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese over lasagna.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place lasagna under the broiler until Colby-Jack cheese is melted and
        bubbling, 3 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
